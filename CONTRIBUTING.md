# Contributing

I :heart: [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for fixing or adding content. Thanks for your contribution!

These pages make use of the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator. Authoring content mostly amounts to authoring documents in [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

For small changes, you can click the "Edit" button on the bottom of any published page, and start
the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process easily. You can use the preview tab in GitHub to make sure that it is properly formatted before committing.

If you plan to contribute often or have a larger change to make, it is best to setup an environment for contribution.
