# Personal Blog Hosted By GitHub Pages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/liuning0820/liuning0820.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/liuning0820/liuning0820.github.io)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/liuning0820/liuning0820.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/liuning0820/liuning0820.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
