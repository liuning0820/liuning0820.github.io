Breakpoint Labels
-----------------

Within Visual Studio, once you’ve created a breakpoint, you can add one or more
labels to it by simply right-clicking and choosing Edit Labels:

![edit-breakpoint-label](http://localhost:4000/liuning0820.github.io/images/e37b1d14e40b84c5c6d9bd39c020fcfe.png)

edit-breakpoint-label

After adding labels to breakpoints, you can view them in the Breakpoints window:

![breakpoints-window](http://localhost:4000/liuning0820.github.io/images/595046a261a8aa9c519b30494ce4a3c8.png)

breakpoints-window

If you present code at conferences, user groups, etc., you may find labeled
breakpoints useful during demos. You can add a label like “Demo1” to some
breakpoints, and “Demo2” to others. Toggle which breakpoints are enabled when
you run your application in order to demonstrate different topics.
