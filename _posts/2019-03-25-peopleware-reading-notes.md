# Reading Notes: Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams

## Part I: Manage The Human Resource

The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.

- The high tech illusion

    The researchers who made fundamental breakthroughs in those areas are in a high-tech business. The rest of us are appliers of their work.

     We use computers and other new technology components to develop our products or to organize our affairs. We are mostly in the human communication business.

    Our successes come from good human interactions.

### Chapter 2: Make a Cheeseburger, Sell a Cheeseburger

- We have to learn to do work less of the time and think about the work more.

    我们必须学会花更少的时间工作和花更多的时间思考工作本身。

### Chapter 3

- People under time pressure don't work better - they just work faster with low quality.

### Chapter 4 Quality

- Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity.

    远远超过超过最终用户需求的质量是取得更高生产力的手段。

### Chapter 5

- Organizational busy work tend to expand to fill the working day.

### Chapter 6

- Lose weight while sleeping

- **False Hope**: Technology is moving swiftly, that you’re being passed by.

    Technology is moving swiftly, but (the High-Tech Illusion again) most of what you’re doing is not truly high-tech work.

- That is Management

    The manager’s function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

## Part II: The Office Environment

In Part II, we’ll look into some of the causes of lost time and propose measures that you can take to create a healthy, work-conducive environment.

### Chapter 8 You never get anything done around here between 9 and 5

If you manage a team of people who need to use their brains during the workday, then the workplace environment (quite,space, and privacy) is your business.

### Chapter 10 Brain Time versus Body Time

- Flow State

The phenomena of flow and immersion give us a more realistic way to model how time is applied to a development task. What matters is not the amount of time you’re present, but the amount of time that you’re working at full potential. An hour in flow really accomplishes something, but 10 six-minute work periods sandwiched between 11 interruptions won’t accomplish anything.

- The E-Factor

E-Factor = Uninterrupted Hours/Body-Present Hours
