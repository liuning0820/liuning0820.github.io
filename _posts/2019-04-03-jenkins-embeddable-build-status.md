# Labs: Jenkins Embeddable Build Status

Jenkins exposes the current status of your build as an icon in a fixed URL. You can put this URL into other sites (such as GitHub README) so that people can see the current state of the build.

- Install "Embeddable Build Status Plugin" at Jenkins -> Plugin Manager
- Go to your job view, and click the "Embeddable Build Status" on the left.
- Get the Markdown format link and put it into your README.md
